@article{Vanderkwaak2000,
abstract = {A fully-integrated numerical model is presented which considers the flow of water and transport of multiple solutes on the two-dimensional land surface and in the three-dimensional, dual-continua subsurface, under variably-saturated conditions. Linkage between the various continua is through first-order, physically based flux relationships or through pressure head and concentration continuity assumptions. Full coupling of flow and transport is achieved by assembling and solving one system of discrete algebraic equations such that water and solute fluxes between continua are determined simultaneously. To achieve a high degree of computational efficiency, robust and efficient discretization and solution techniques are utilized. The numerical model was tested by simulating a controlled field experiment described by Abdul and Gillham (1989) involving coupled surface-subsurface flow and tracer transport in a small subcatchment at CFB Bordon, Ontario. Observed surface discharge volumes and timings arising from the application of artificial rainfall containing a tracer were simulated with reasonable accuracy using published or measured parameter values and minimal calibration. The observed dynamic response is shown to be a nonlinear function of surface and subsurface flow processes that are affected by subsurface permeability, surface roughness, topography, and initial conditions. Excess rainfall and groundwater seepage that flows overland initially, generate surface ponding within microtopographic depressions, including those located in the initially dry stream channel. The ponded surface water forms an internal, transient constraint on the porous medium pressure head near the land surface which is not reflected in solutions making use of traditional seepage face algorithms. The dominant streamflow mechanism deduced from the simulations is infiltration excess over an increasing contributing area, with the contributing area controlled by rapid response of the capillary fringe. Water originating above the initial water table overshadows groundwater contributions in this case.},

abstract = "Two field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of the capillary fringe on surface water-groundwater interactions and on streamflow generation in a shallow water-table aquifer. The results from both experiments showed that the water-table adjacent to the stream, where the capillary fringe extended to or close to ground surface, responded rapidly to the precipitation events due to the initially low storage capacity of the medium. This rapid and large response led to the development of a water-table mound on both sides of the stream and flow nets showed that the mound resulted in the discharge of pre-event water through the seepage faces that developed on both sides of the stream. Furthermore, the mound contributed to the discharge of event water in that precipitation falling on the seepage faces was transported directly to the stream as overland flow. A further contribution of event water to the stream occurred as surface runoff from areas upslope of the seepage faces, where the pressure head was zero, but the rainfall rate exceeded the infiltration capacity of the soil. Under the conditions of the study, the results support the commonly recognized mechanisms of streamflow generation, including the partial area, variable-source-area overland flow, and variable-source-area subsurface flow concepts. The relative contribution of these mechanisms to stormflow appeared to be determined by the response of the capillary fringe. The amount of pre-event water in the discharge determined by the tracer method of hydrograph separation showed good agreement with the instantaneous pre-event discharge hydrograph determined from flow nets."

abstract = {Abstract Emphasizing the physical intricacies of integrated hydrology and feedbacks in simulating connected, variably saturated groundwater-surface water systems, the Integrated Hydrologic Model Intercomparison Project initiated a second phase (IH-MIP2), increasing the complexity of the benchmarks of the first phase. The models that took part in the intercomparison were ATS, Cast3M, CATHY, GEOtop, HydroGeoSphere, MIKE-SHE, and ParFlow. IH-MIP2 benchmarks included a tilted v-catchment with 3-D subsurface; a superslab case expanding the slab case of the first phase with an additional horizontal subsurface heterogeneity; and the Borden field rainfall-runoff experiment. The analyses encompassed time series of saturated, unsaturated, and ponded storages, as well as discharge. Vertical cross sections and profiles were also inspected in the superslab and Borden benchmarks. An analysis of agreement was performed including systematic and unsystematic deviations between the different models. Results show generally good agreement between the different models, which lends confidence in the fundamental physical and numerical implementation of the governing equations in the different models. Differences can be attributed to the varying level of detail in the mathematical and numerical representation or in the parameterization of physical processes, in particular with regard to ponded storage and friction slope in the calculation of overland flow. These differences may become important for specific applications such as detailed inundation modeling or when strong inhomogeneities are present in the simulation domain.},
